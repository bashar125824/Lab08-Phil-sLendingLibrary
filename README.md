***In this image , we **added** 2 books , first one with **title : Test Book** , and author **first name : Osama** and the second one is with **title : Test Book 2** and author **first name : Bashar** , then show the library contents (the green boundary)***


***In the red boundary , we **borrowed** a book that is **Test Book** , this mean that we **deleted** a book from the library , so the remain book is with title : **Test Book 2** .***


***In the blue boundary , we **returned** the book with title : **Test Book** , so the library became as first time we added the two books , it's now contain the books with **Test Book** and **Test Book 2** titles .***
